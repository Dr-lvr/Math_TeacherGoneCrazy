# Math_TeacherGoneCrazy
Study of a simple polynomial factorization problem in parallel computing to be published on the Codewars website 

##DESCRIPTION
On Friday, after the teachers' evening meeting, the math teacher went crazy.
After drinking a few beers; talking to the chemistry and religion professors,
he returned home and surrounded herself with ancient math books,
candles and graphs drawn in chalk on the floor. . .
the professor afterwards was never the same.
Rumor has it that Monday morning, when he returned to school,
his students were roasted by strange expressions followed by devastating grades and notes of demerit.
Sure the school will go into action,
but tomorrow morning at the first hour you know that you will have to face the teacher,
and perhaps with a good gab and a clear mind you could be able to bring the teacher back to his hindsight.
Or at least take a sufficient vote, and thus enter the legend.
